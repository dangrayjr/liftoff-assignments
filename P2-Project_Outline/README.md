### Overview
Simple Expense tracker that would be able to record purchases made and be able to provide running tab of available funds from selected financial accounts. The user could either set up catagories for budgeting. The app could notify user if funds are not currently available.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I would have to learn how to collect basic financial information to have the current balance be indicated.  Set up a SQL that could collect information that could be recalled easily and be comparable to current balance. I could try to have the user set a threshold amount that would send and notification to the user if that has been reached via SMS or Push notification.
